# ECG_README.md

#### Description
These data were extracted from the European ST-T database from [physionet](https://physionet.org/about/database/). A full description can be found at https://physionet.org/content/edb/1.0.0/. Excerpts of this description are included below.

The European ST-T Database is intended to be used for evaluation of algorithms for analysis of ST and T-wave changes. This database consists of 90 annotated excerpts of ambulatory ECG recordings from 79 subjects. The subjects were 70 men aged 30 to 84, and 8 women aged 55 to 71. Myocardial ischemia was diagnosed or suspected for each subject.

Two cardiologists worked independently to annotate each record beat-by-beat and for changes in ST segment and T-wave morphology, rhythm, and signal quality. A description of the annotation categories can be seen in the table below.


#### Structure
Data from a single subject were placed into a more easily accessible format on 7/26/22 by DJ.
This simplified data file contains the following fields:
- ecg_voltage: an array of electrocardiogram data
- fs: the sampling frequency in Hz
- label_samples: the samples when an event occurred
- label_symbols: the corresponding symbols (representing an event type as - described in the table below)
- subject_id: an identifier for the subject
- electrode: the name of the ECG electrode being recorded
- units: the voltage units of ecg_voltage
